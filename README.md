## Scientific Computing Algorithms

The repository contains MATLAB implementations of various useful algorithms in the field of Scientific Computing. 

These algorithms were created for my Scientific Computing course (CS 5743) at the University of Oklahoma during the Fall 2016 semester.

## Solving Triangular Systems

* Lower Triangular : Lx_b.m
* Upper Triangular : Ux_b.m

### Decomposition Algorithms

* Cholesky Decomposition : cholesky_decomposition.m
* LU Decomposition : LU_decomposition.m
* QR Decomposition : QR_decomposition.m
* Singular Value Decomposition : svd_decomposition.m

### Iterative Methods

* Jacobi : jacobi.m
* Gauss-Seidel : gauss_seidel.m
* Successive Over-Relaxation : sor.m

### Gradient Methods

* Gradient Descent : gradient_descent.m
* Conjugate Gradient : conjugate_gradient.m

### Solving Systems 

* Use Cholesky/LU Decomposition, Lower & Upper Triangular algorithms to solve Ax = b : Ax_b.m
* Use QR Decomposition & Upper Triangular algorithms to solve Z = Hx : Z_Hx_QR.m
* Use Singular Value Decomposition algorithm to solve Z = Hx : Z_Hx_SVD.m
